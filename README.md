# Graph Shortest Path
This repository implements algorithms for finding the shortest path in a graph. It provides solutions to two main problems:
1. Finding the lexicographically smallest path with minimum travel time between islands in a coastal city.
2. Organizing a city tour that starts from a specific city, includes another city, and returns to the starting point.
## Features
- Implementation of a graph data structure.
- Algorithms to find the shortest path using BFS and DFS techniques.
- Solutions for both coastal city routes and city tour problems.
## Usage
The repository contains Java implementations for:
- Graph structure
- Shortest path algorithms
- Input parsing and output formatting
## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit pull requests for improvements or bug fixes.
